## Jakub's code challenge
I created this project using NextJS (create-next-app)
Other technologies used are react-query, Material UI, and Typescript.

## Getting Started
Just pull, install packages, and then start dev.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
