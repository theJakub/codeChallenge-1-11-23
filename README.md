## Jakub's code challenge
I created this project using NextJS (create-next-app)
Other technologies used are react-query, Material UI, and Typescript.

I found it somewhat tedious to find an endpoint to use. The public-apis project hasn't been updated in several months and I found many of the endpoints were out of date in one way or another. I also wanted to find something I had some interest in. Due to these requirements I put on the api I went with the first one I found that actually worked. The returned data was a very small set, but I wanted to get going on the logic. I do have another branch that I worked on at the very end that had a slightly bigger data set to work with. You can see that in the PR section of this repo.

## Getting Started
